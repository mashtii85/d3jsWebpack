# Intruduction

In this repository I used Webpack, Bootstrap and D3js. also prettier and eslint
The reason I picked webpack is that it will automate lots of boilerplate things, also we have an npm package so we can see our all deps just in one place not importing them on HTML page and worry about wether they fetched and compile successfuly.
Every file has it's own DocType and every function has a description to make them easier to use.

# Installation
Please install npm packages before run the project

# Have word
It was really fun and get to know d3js much better, that is an awsome lib, thank you for your time and letting me to have this opportunity
